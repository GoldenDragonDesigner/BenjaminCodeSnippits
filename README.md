This Repository is for those that would like to view the code that I have worked on over the years

In this Repository it is setup in a way to show the progression of how I built my AI system for my capstone project and also in Brushlings Pale Moon.

Please do not edit these scripts without asking for permission as I have spent a lot of time on them and would like to preserve what I have done.

BB_GuardStateMachine.cs is the first introduction for how an AI system can be setup in Unity3D using the Nav Mesh.  I used BB_GuardStateMachine as a referenece to create DirtySlug.cs.  I made the AI move around the screen with Nav Points.
